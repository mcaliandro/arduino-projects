# Lampduino
I created my personal LED lamp with an Arduino board and Adafruit NeoPixel ring

## Supplies
- Arduino LilyPad w/ ATMega 328G
- Adafuit NeoPixels ring (I used a 12 leds ring)

## Arduino Libraries
- Adafuit_NeoPixel

## Description
For this project, I created a C++ class (called *NeoPixelManager*) that manages the NeoPixels ring for performing some light effects. Now, the class implements 8 light effects.
